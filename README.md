# Pokemon App ![Image](img/icon.png) 

## About the Project
I created a small web application that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail. It will display a list of different pokemons that will, once clicked upon, show some of the pokemon characteristics.<br /><br />

## Key Features:
- Load data from an external source (API)
- View a list of items
- On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item

## Build Dependencies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
  - jQuery
  - Bootstrap <br /><br />

### API implemented
The API used for this project is: https://pokeapi.co/ <br /><br />
